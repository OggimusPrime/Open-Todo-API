## Open Todo API:

 An externally usable API for a basic todo list application that allows users to
 modify user accounts, todo lists, and items from the command line.

 Created as a project during my <a href="http://bloc.io">Bloc</a> full stack web development apprenticeship.

### Note:
 This app uses <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers">Active Model Serializers</a> to transform specified attributes into
 JSON output.

 An authenticated method has been defined in api_controller which expects a user
 to provide their username and password in the Curl command.
